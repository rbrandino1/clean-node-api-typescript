## **Clean Architecture - Node API**

Study project -> Design of an API with a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD (test-oriented programming) as the working methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities in layers, always following the principles of SOLID


> ### Principles

* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* Open Closed Principle (OCP)
* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
* Separation of Concerns (SOC)
* Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
* You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)
* Keep It Simple, Silly (KISS)
* Composition Over Inheritance

> ### Design Patterns

* Factory
* Adapter
* Composite
* Decorator
* Proxy
* Dependency Injection
* Abstract Server
* Composition Root
* Builder
* Singleton

> ### Methodologies and Designs

* TDD
* Clean Architecture
* DDD
* Conventional Commits
* GitFlow
* Modular Design
* Dependency Diagrams
* Use Cases
* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Delivery
* Continuous Deployment

> ### Libs and Tools
